# .* Toolkit Utils
This library contains various utilities for writing parsers.
It contains three sections:
1. `bytes`: contains Byteorder like functions for reading integers and strings from byte slices.
2. `testing`: contains alternatives to the assert! family that return Results instead of panicking.
3. `vfs`: contains traits for a virtual filesystem and some basic filesystems that allow for parsing without extracting
